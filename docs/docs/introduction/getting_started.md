## About the Klicker UZH

Klicker UZH is a web application that supports the interaction between speakers and their audience and does so in various ways. During a Klicker session (e.g., a lecture), a speaker may pose questions to be answered by participants over their computer or mobile devices. Additionally, the audience may rate the speed and difficulty of the session and provide open feedback, if so desired by the speaker. Next to the well-known speaker-to-audience interaction, this also enables interactions initiated by the audience, which can serve as a useful orientation to the lecturer.

Klicker UZH was developed by the Teaching Center of the Department of Banking and Finance at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. It has been in heavy use for many years (both in- and outside of our University), and the foundations have gotten outdated over the course of these years which led to the relaunch of the tool. Klicker UZH 2.0 is built on a state-of-the-art foundation and adds many highly requested features and functionalities. Furthermore, the development and code of our new tool are entirely open-source, allowing for further extensibility.
