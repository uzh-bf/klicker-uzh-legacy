title: Participant Authentication
---

Participant authentication allows to restrict access to your polls. There are two ways to do that.

1. **Password Distribution:** You upload arbitrary usernames, which are then be combined 
with passwords, and you receive a list of username-password combinations. This list can then be
distributed to all participants. 

2. **SwitchAAI:** Here you upload a list of SwitchAAI accounts (email address). The participants 
can then, if they are on the list, log in with their SwitchAAI account.
